The proposed project aims to develop a platform for students and registered startups of an Innovation Centre to provide updates, share their accomplishments, connect with developers, professors, and companies. The platform will serve as a central hub for innovation and entrepreneurship, allowing students and startups to showcase their projects, highlight their achievements, and connect with potential partners and mentors. Registered startups will have access to a dashboard where they can manage their profile, post updates, and connect with potential investors and customers. Students will be able to create profiles, explore startup projects, and connect with mentors and professors to gain insights and support for their own projects.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87925991/226148797-fa31f4a8-dfdc-4904-a643-2f7aa843f9df.png)
